Logging
--------

Standard logging in Mattermost can output logs to the console and to file targets. Mattermost Enterprise customers can configure `advanced audit logging <https://docs.mattermost.com/comply/audit-log.html>`__ to output any combination of console, local file, syslog, and TCP socket targets, and send those log records to multiple targets. 

Performance monitoring tools
-----------------------------

Mattermost Enterprise customers can track system health for large deployments through integrations with `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`__ and `Grafana <https://grafana.com/>`__. See the `performance monitoring <https://docs.mattermost.com/scale/performance-monitoring.html>`__ documentation for details.

Workspace optimization tools
----------------------------

From Mattermost v6.5, you can review your workspace health and growth scores in the System Console, then take advantage of recommended actions to ensure your workspace is running smoothly. See the `workspace optimizatio <https://docs.mattermost.com/configure/optimize-your-workspace.html>`__ documentation to learn more.
